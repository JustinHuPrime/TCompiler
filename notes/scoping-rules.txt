Every module has a module name.
The code module is an implementation of the decl module with the same name.
Decl files have unique module names, code files have unique module names.

All things have a fully qualified name. This is <module_name>::<thing_name>.
A fully qualified name is unambiguous within the current set of imported modules.
Can also use an unqualified name. (<thing_name>). First, look in current module for that thing.
Then, look through all imported modules, and get the only one that names it. If multiple, issue diagnostic.
If the scoped thing's module doesn't exist, check if the scoped thing's module is actually an enum.
